# Icon
Daily UI #5

Today's UI challenge requested the designer to create an icon (for social media, et cetera). I created one for the restaurant I manage.
As a bonus challenge to myself, I modified the element to display a neon effect upon hover (in direct reference to our very own pink neon sign) and used a brief 
JS function that allows a user to click on the element, subsequently redirecting them to our Instagram page.
